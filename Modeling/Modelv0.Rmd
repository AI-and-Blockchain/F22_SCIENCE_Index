## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Read in data file
```{r}
data <- read.csv("authorsWyears.csv")
```

# (NOT USED) Scale all necessary data columns
```{r}
scaled <- data
scaled$CareerLength <- scale(scaled$careerLength) 
scaled$PaperCount <- scale(scaled$PaperCount)
scaled$CitationCount <- scale(scaled$CitationCount)
```

Split into training and testing data
```{r}
library(caTools)

set.seed(1)

split_set <- data
sample <- sample.split(split_set$AuthorId, SplitRatio = 0.7)
train  <- subset(split_set, sample == TRUE)
test   <- subset(split_set, sample == FALSE)
```

Perform linear regression on scaled
```{r}
lm_paper_career <- lm(log(PaperCount)~careerLength, train)
lm_citation_career <- lm(log(CitationCount)~careerLength, train)
```

Train data on lr and see pred  iction difference from actual
```{r}
pred_paper_career <- predict(object = lm_paper_career, test)
pred_citation_career <- predict(object = lm_citation_career, test) 
```

Calculate MSE
```{r}
mse_paper_career <- mean((pred_paper_career - test$PaperCount)^2)
mse_citation_career <- mean((pred_citation_career - test$CitationCount)^2)
```

```{r}
test_sample <- test[1:100, ]
testx <- test_sample$careerLength
#testy1 <- pred_paper_career[1:10]
testy1 <- test_sample$PaperCount
testy2 <- test_sample$CitationCount

plot(testx, testy1,
    main='CareerLength vs PaperCount',
    xlab='CareerLength',
    ylab='PaperCount')
abline(lm_paper_career)

plot(testx, testy2,
    main='CareerLength vs CitationCount',
    xlab='CareerLength',
    ylab='CitationCount')
abline(lm_citation_career)
```
